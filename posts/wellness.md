title: 'Wellness Campaigns'
description: 'A series of three campaigns to support membersâ€™ physical and mental health: <a href="https://www.upmchealthplan.com/weightrace">Weight Race</a>, <a href="https://www.upmchealthplan.com/findyourfitness">Find Your Fitness</a>, and <a href="https://www.upmchealthplan.com/roadtoresilience">Road to Resilience</a>. Each campaign runs over a specific 12 or 4 week period, delivering a new content topic every week. I designed and developed templated micro sites to make it easier to swap out the creative design and content for each campaign, but keep the general structure and logic reusable across the three campaigns and for each annual refresh. The sites were built with Gatsby and used Sanity for Content Management.'
