title: 'SVG Map Generator'
description: 'The tool I created allows users to create coverage maps quickly. This was previously a tedious process that required design and development resources, but now anyone can easily create a coverage map on their own. In addition to saving time, the tool also allows for better accessibility of the content in the map by using SVG instead of a JPG.'

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js let's you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
